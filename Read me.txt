A. Mixed evidence of oxidative shielding in the ejaculates of male banded mongooses
Citation: Ecology and Evolution submission
Abstract: A paradox for life-history theory is that breeders appear to sustain lower levels of oxidative damage than non-breeders, despite the expectation of an oxidative cost of reproduction. The  oxidative shielding hypothesis proposes that oxidative defences are elevated during reproduction to protect offspring from oxidative damage during critical early development. While there is some empirical evidence of oxidative shielding in females, there have been no tests of this hypothesis in males, despite evidence of oxidative costs of male reproductive effort and the vulnerability of sperm cells to oxidative damage.  Here, we tested the oxidative shielding hypothesis in male banded mongooses by assessing lipid oxidative damage (MDA) in the ejaculates of reproducing and non-reproducing males. We found that ejaculate MDA levels were lower during mate competition compared to 2 months post-competition, however breeders and non-breeding individuals did not have significantly different MDA levels during mate competition. These findings offer mixed support of oxidative shielding in the ejaculates of male banded mongooses. More work is needed to understand whether such mechanisms are prevalent in nature, and to what extent protecting the next generation from intergenerational oxidative insults is a joint effort by both sexes.
